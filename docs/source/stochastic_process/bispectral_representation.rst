Third-order Spectral Representation Method
-------------------------------------------

The third-order Spectral Representation Method (or Bispectral Representation Method) is a generalization of the
SpectralRepresentation for processes possessing a known power spectrum and bispectrum. Implementation follows from
references [8]_ and [9]_. The multi-variate formulation from reference [10]_ is not currently implemented.
