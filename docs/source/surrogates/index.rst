Surrogates
==========

This module contains functionality for all the surrogate methods supported in UQpy.

The module currently contains the following classes:

- :class:`.SROM`: Class to estimate a discrete approximation for a continuous random variable using Stochastic Reduced Order Model.

- :class:`.Kriging`: Class to generate an approximate surrogate model using kriging.

- :class:`.PolynomialChaosExpansion`: Class to generate an approximate surrogate model using Polynomial chaos.
