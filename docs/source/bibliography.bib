abstract = {In this paper, we provide a framework based upon diffusion processes for finding meaningful geometric descriptions of data sets. We show that eigenfunctions of Markov matrices can be used to construct coordinates called diffusion maps that generate efficient representations of complex geometric structures. The associated family of diffusion distances, obtained by iterating the Markov matrix, defines multiscale geometries that prove to be useful in the context of data parametrization and dimensionality reduction. The proposed framework relates the spectral properties of Markov processes to their geometric counterparts and it unifies ideas arising in a variety of contexts such as machine learning, spectral graph theory and eigenmap methods.}

abstract = {Summary In this work, an adaptive simplex stochastic collocation method is introduced in which sample refinement is informed by variability in the solution of the system. The proposed method is based on the concept of multi-element stochastic collocation methods and is capable of dealing with very high-dimensional models whose solutions are expressed as a vector, a matrix, or a tensor. The method leverages random samples to create a multi-element polynomial chaos surrogate model that incorporates local anisotropy in the refinement, informed by the variance of the estimated solution. This feature makes it beneficial for strongly nonlinear and/or discontinuous problems with correlated non-Gaussian uncertainties. To solve large systems, a reduced-order model (ROM) of the high-dimensional response is identified using singular value decomposition (higher-order SVD for matrix/tensor solutions) and polynomial chaos is used to interpolate the ROM. The method is applied to several stochastic systems of varying type of response (scalar/vector/matrix) and it shows considerable improvement in performance compared to existing simplex stochastic collocation methods and adaptive sparse grid collocation methods.},
