Diffusion Maps
--------------------------------

Diffusion Maps [1]_ is a nonlinear dimension reduction technique used to learn (i.e., parametrize) a manifold from some data.
Diffusion maps are based on the assumption that the data is represented in a high-dimensional space, while the points lie
close to a low-dimensional manifold. The algorithm constructs a Markov Chain
based on the available data. The probabilities of this Markov Chain define how probable a transition between two  points is
in one time step of the diffusion process. Then, the eigenfunctions of the Markov matrix are used to obtain a
coordinate system that reveals the embedded geometry of the data.



The :class:`.DiffusionMaps` class is imported using the following command:
