SROM on a Gamma distribution 2
======================================================================

In this example, Stratified sampling is used to generate samples from Gamma distribution and weights are defined using
Stochastic Reduce Order Model (SROM). This example illustrate how to define same weights for each sample of a
random variable.

# Run SROM using the defined Gamma distribution. Here we use the following parameters.
#
# - Gamma distribution with shape, shift and scale parameters as 2, 1 and 3.
# - First and second order moments about origin are 6 and 54.
# - Notice that pdf_target references the Gamma function directly and does not designate it as a string.
# - Samples are uncorrelated, i.e. also default value of correlation.

# In this case, sample_weights are generated using default values of weights_distribution, weights_moments and
# weights_correlation. Default values are:

# A note on the weights corresponding to distribution, moments and correlation of random variables:
#
# - For this illustration, default weights_moments are square of reciprocal of moments. Thus, moments should be of
