Chatterjee indices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These examples serve as a guide for using the Chatterjee sensitivity module. They have been taken from various papers to enable validation of the implementation and have been referenced accordingly.

1. Ishigami function

2. Exponential function

For the Exponential model, analytical Cramer-von Mises indices are available, since they are equivalent to the Chatterjee indices, they are shown here.

3. Sobol function

This example was considered in [1] page 18.
