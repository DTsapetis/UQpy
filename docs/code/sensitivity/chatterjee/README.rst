Chatterjee indices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
These examples serve as a guide for using the Chatterjee sensitivity module. They have been taken from various papers to enable validation of the implementation and have been referenced accordingly.

1. **Ishigami function**

    In addition to the Pick and Freeze scheme, the Sobol indices can be estimated using the rank statistics approach :cite:`gamboa2020global`. We demonstrate this estimation of the Sobol indices using the Ishigami function.

2. **Exponential function**

    For the Exponential model, analytical Cram√©r-von Mises indices are available :cite:`CVM` and since they are equivalent to the Chatterjee indices in the sample limit, they are shown here.

3. **Sobol function**

    This example was considered in :cite:`gamboa2020global` (page 18) to compare the Pick and Freeze scheme with the rank statistics approach for estimating the Sobol indices.
