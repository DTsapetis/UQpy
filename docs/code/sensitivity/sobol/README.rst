Sobol Sensitivity indices
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These examples serve as a guide for using the Sobol sensitivity module. They have been taken from various papers to enable validation of the implementation and have been referenced accordingly.

Single output models
======================
We demonstrate the computation of the Sobol indices for models with a single output using the following examples:

1. Ishigami function
2. Exponential function
3. Sobol function with parameters a := [0., 0.5, 3., 9., 99., 99.] : Example from [2] page 11

Multiple output models
========================

We demonstrate the computation of the Sobol indices for models with multiple outputs using the following example:

1. Mechanical oscillator ODE (numerical model): Example from [1] page 19
