"""
This module contains functionality for all the sampling methods supported in ``UQpy``.

The module currently contains the following classes:

- ``MonteCarloSampling``: Class to perform Monte Carlo sampling.
- ``LatinHypercubeSampling``: Class to perform Latin hypercube sampling.
- ``MCMC``: Class to perform Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling.
- ``ImportanceSampling``: Class to perform Importance sampling.
- ``AdaptiveKriging``: Class to perform adaptive kriging Monte Carlo sampling.
- ``StratifiedSampling``: Class to perform stratified sampling.
- ``RefinedStratifiedSampling``: Class to perform refined stratified sampling.
- ``SimplexSampling``: Class to uniformly sample from a simplex.
